            <p>
                Josie is a new character added in Tekken 7, shes from the Philippines and fighting style is based on eskrima and muay Thai. She is described to be bright, cheerful and energetic but
                is prone to crying due to past trauma.
                Josie is a relatively easy character to pick up since she's new, she has lesser moves compared to rest of the cast. She is more of a pressure-based
                characters which a lot of strings that lead to mix-ups, alongside with really powerful low attacks, she can easily punish people for pushing
                buttons when they are not supposed to. Josie also has really good punish with a 13frame launcher which only 1 other character has, and if done
                right it can lead to heavy damage, alongside most character she has a strong wall game which leads to easy damage. Josie has great counterhit tools
                and whiff punishment with a sway back and feints, not to mention her main stance that absolutely punishes trigger happy people. In the newer season
                she was given a new string, which now allows her to combo into more damage and carries the enemy closer to the wall for more heavy damage.
