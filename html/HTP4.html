        <h1>wallgame</h1>
        <p>
            when your enemy is next to a wall, it is possible to extend your combo by doing a wall combo or bouncing them off the wall. If enough damage
            is done against the wall, it will <b>break and transition to another stage</b> but the enemy will be floated which you can continue your combos for
            more damage.
        </p>
        <h1>knowledge</h1>
        <p>
            There's a lot of characters with an average of 100 moves each, it's <b>key</b> to learn match-ups to properly punish blocked moves. Although you are able
            to win matches early on without much knowledge but in higher levels most players learned their match-ups which instantly put you at a disadvantage.
            For example in one of lee's combo, if you block the whole string it cannot be punished, you have to test it out in training mode to find out that
            only if you crouch the last hit then you will be able to punish it. Even characters like Kuma have a weirder hitbox and combos might not work,
            thus it's beneficial to learn match-ups and how to deal with common moves.

        </p>
        <h1>mind-games</h1>
        <p>
            Mind-games is an <b>advanced concept</b> and will really be important once you reach a higher level of play.
            <b>Baiting</b> is an example of mind-games, <b>dashing in and out of enemy attack range to try to have the enemy whiff an attack</b>, however people
            are thought to not randomly press buttons and thus you would have to condition them to be trigger happy, you could dash up and throw often to condition
            then to jab when you dash in and that's where you can bait moves out of them.
            Even certain playstyle relay on this concept, Arlash-ash a Pakistan player has a defensive playstyle, all he does is poke to frustrate his enemy, that
            when they will be riskier and Arlash ash can punish them for taking a risk.
