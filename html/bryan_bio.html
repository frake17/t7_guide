                <h1 class="name">Bryan<br />Fury</h1>
                <p>
                    Bryan first appeared in Tekken 3, he's from USA and his fighting style is mainly kickboxing. He is a brutish, unfeeling and overall psychotic cyborg, all
                    he wants is to create havoc and misery, alongside him iconic evil laugh is what makes him a very popular character among players.
                    Bryan has one of the hardest execution in the game, if you mastered his execution you will be set with all the other character's execution. Alongside
                    with his hard execution, his gameplan revolves about counter-hitting and punish, which makes him one of the hardest characters to play, having to play
                    mind games and opening the enemy up isn't an easy thing.
                    Most of his moves launch on counter-hit and can cause huge damage, however his punish before 14 frames are weak, as his 10frame punish is weak and don't
                    lead to any combos, only his 14 frame punish is able to lead to combos.
                    He does have an infamous "taunt jet upper" it forces your enemy to eat an unblockable taunt before getting hit by a guaranteed launcher, however its
                    extremely hard to pull off, you only have about 1 frame(1/25 second) to input the command but its very rewarding if you can pull it off.
