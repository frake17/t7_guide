            <p>
                king first appeared in Tekken 3, he's from Mexico and his fighting style is pro-wrestling mainly Mexican pro-wrestling also known as Lucha Libre. He is
                kind and caring as his predecessor was also a pro-wrestler and was the one who brought him up.
                King is a unique character, unlike all the other characters his gameplay is mostly based on throws and grabs. Although all of the throws are breakable by the guidelines,
                it's harder to practice as there are many different throws with different breaks. He has pretty weak lows but makes ups with good 50/50 throws which lead to insane damage,
                however, if the enemy knows how to break throws, king becomes weak as he cant rely on his most powerful aspect, thus king is rarely seen in pro-play
