        <h1>Whiff punishing</h1>
        <p>
            It's the same concept as punishing but instead of blocking, you are trying to <b>trick your enemy to miss their attacks</b> letting you freely hit him.
            This can be done using <b>side-step or bashdash</b>, but this require more <b>matchup knowledge and anticipation</b>, however, it would be better as you
            have a bigger window to punish which usually leads to higher damage.
        </p>
        <h1>Throw break</h1>
        <p>
            In most fighting game there are throws, but in tekken 7 there are different type of throws that require a certin button break.
            But the main guideline is if the <b>left or right hand is in front when starting the throw its usually a 1 or 2 break</b>, however if <b>both hand are the same its a 1+2 break.</b>
            However sometimes its too hard to see if the one of the hand if in front or not, thus you should try breaking it in training mode,
            for example pual's throw has him lift his leg up which is way easier to react to.
        </p>
        <h1>frames</h1>
        <p>
            Frames are more of an <b>advanced concept</b>, in every move there is a start-up frame. For example crouch jabs are 10 frames, and since start-up is 10 frames
            recovery frame is also 10, which means you can't block or attack within 10 frames. But if it hits or gets blocked, it has different properties.
            If a move is <b>-5 on block</b>, it just means it takes <b>5 more frames to recover</b>, if it's <b>+5 it takes 5 frames lesser to recover</b>.
            It's important to understand common moves frames, as one of law's moves is a frame trap. That certain move is + on block, people who don't know much
            about frame data would be tempted to push a button, but since it's + on block law can follow up with any of his moves and counterhit the enemy, and this
            is the basis of a frame trap, using frame advantage to "trap" unknowing players.
