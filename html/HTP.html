        <h1>footsies</h1>
        <p>
            In street fighter matches, players can be seen spamming projectiles, non-fighting game players may just think its spam. <br>However, there's meaning to every projectile thrown,
            whether if its to <b>frustrate the enemy</b> or <b>controlling the spacing between them</b>.<br>Footsies is that, it is the <b>ground-based aspect of fighting games.</b>
            It is the fundamentals of all fighting games,you can refer to the <a href="https://sonichurricane.com/?page_id=1702">footsies handbook</a> if you want to know more.
        </p>
        <h1>life lead</h1>
        <p>
            Everyone has a set amount of health(170), your goal is to deplete your enemy's health to win the match while keeping yours from dropping to 0.
            <br>Life lead is when your health bar is <b>higher</b> than your enemy's, by having a life lead you will be able to <b>do more risky moves without the risk of
            dying.</b> <br>However, if you don't have a life lead its best if you poke and try to inch yourself back to getting
            life lead.
        </p>
        <h1>movement</h1>
        <p>
            Movement is <b>important</b> in all fighting games, it helps you control the match by <b>maximizing the efficiency of your movement and minimizing the efficiency of the opponent's</b>
            The basic movements are <b>forward, backward and side-step,forwarding and backward dash</b> is useful for whiff punishing.Advance movements such as <b>wavedash and Korean backdash</b> are not required to learn, but will
            greatly benefit users who learned it, it is advised to only learn this once you have the fundamentals hammered down.
            Movement doesn't seem hard at first, but every movement nneds to have to have a reason, either to have the enemy <b>second guess their moves or to bait.</b>
