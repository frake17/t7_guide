        <p>
            Tekken 7 is a <b>3D fighting game</b>, where you pick a character from a pool of characters and fight other people either online or offline.
            <br>Let's get to know the control scheme, there's the typical forward, crouch, jump, and backward, to dash or side-step tap the movement key twice,
            and <b>4 attacks</b>(left and right punch, left and right kick), but is more widely known as 1,2,3 or 4.
        </p>
        <h2>Hit propeties</h2>
        <p>
            There are some special properties like <b>counter hit, punish</b>, and <b>armor</b>. <br><b>Counter hit</b> is when your attack managed to hit while the enemy is pressing a button, and
            depending on the moves it may know down or launch for heavy damage. <br><b>Armor moves</b> are moves that cannot be stopped and will power through all attacks, although they still take damage.
        </p>
        <h1>2D vs 3D</h1>
        <p>
            As you know tekken 7 is a 3D fighting game, which is different from more popular guys like street fighter which is mostly 2d or 2.5d more specifically.<br>
            Although 2D is more common and popular compared to 3d, both have their key differences and it's entirely based on your prefereances.<br>
            The main difference is that in 3d games you can <b>move back, forward, and side-step</b>,thus it
            created an added layer of difficulty which I will dive deeper into later on. <br>Another big difference is the <b>lack of air-game</b>, jumping is gone from the game and with
            that the skill of doing an anti-air which is a key fundamental in most 2d fighting game.
