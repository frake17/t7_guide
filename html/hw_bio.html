            <h1 class="name" style="margin-top: 10%;">Hwoarang</h1>
            <p>
                Hwoarang first appeared in Tekken 3, he's from South Korea and fighting style is based on taekwondo.
                He is a hot-headed, impulsive person who likes fighting. He's arrogant and bashful and doesn't like to take orders from anyone.
                Hwoarang though may seem very easy, but since he has about 150 moves and various stances witch is a lot, it will take months for you to remember the moves and use them in
                online matches. Alongside with people like Yoshi and lars, if the enemy knows how to guard against all his attacks, it is hard for Hwoarang to try and open
                them up, thus again he is also rarely seen in pro-play. He is a rush-down guy who depends on mix-ups to deal with the damage, and due to that he does not have any
                moves with a huge range like Bryan, he has to find a way to rush in and do his thing.
                To sum it up, he is a pure rush-down guy, he relies on counter-hits to kill beginner players while he has to rely on mix-ups and continue hitting the enemy who knows
                how to guard against him.
