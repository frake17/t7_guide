        <h1>Blocking</h1>
        <p>
            Side-stepping is a new concept in 3D games, however, if you don't know the reasons why you should side-step the best option would be to just block.
            <br>There are 3 main types of moves, <b>high/middle/lower attacks</b>, and there are 2 ways of <b>guarding standing and crouching, standing guard blocks
            high and mids while couching dodges high and throws while blocking lows.</b>
            However, there are special cases, for example, a crouching jab is mid that won't hit a couching target, many moves like this exist due to the hitbox, some
            combos of moves may miss.
        </p>
        <h1>Wake-up</h1>
        <p>
            Once you get knocked down, you have many options to attack or try to create distance between you and the enemy.
            There are a total of 5 wakeup movement options<b>(instant,delayed,forward roll,backwards roll and side-roll)</b>,
            and 3 main attack options<b>(low, mid, and a mid that know down on hit, they can be done after a roll to make sure the moves hits).</b>
            Each option has their uses based on the enemy, it's recommended <b>to not use the same option consistently</b>
            as they might catch on to it and punish you.
        </p>
        <h1>Punishing</h1>
        <p>
            Punishing is done when you managed to <b>block a move and strike him back which usually leads to a combo</b>, however, to have the optimized punish require great
            knowledge about the enemy's character. Although punishing requires good reaction too, usually pro players
            can "read" their enemy and anticipate their next moves and able to consistently punish them, this comes with the ability to <b>understand the enemy's
            pattern and able to learn how to deal with it.</b>
